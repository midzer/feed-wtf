<p><b>feed.wtf</b> is a community-driven project to make RSS/JSON feeds available to everyone.</p>
<p>For individual user pages you are free to customize your feed. Whereas city pages (with over 25k population) should contain only local authorities, associations, blogs and newspapers feeds.</p>
<p><b>Notice</b>: Right now, it is not possible to remove entered feeds directly. Leave me a message at mail[at]midzer[dot]de and I can help you out.</p>
